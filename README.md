## Key Features

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   The raw dataset undergoes a rigorous cleaning process to handle:  
   - Missing values     
   - Inconsistent data formats  

2. **Feature Engineering (FE)**  
   Transforming raw data into meaningful features to improve model performance. This includes:  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Generating new features based on domain knowledge  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Gaining insights from the dataset through:  
   - Visualizing key patterns and trends  
   - Uncovering the factors that influence churn  

4. **Model Building & Evaluation**  
   Using classification algorithms to predict churn and evaluating model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   Exploring different trees to predict churn
